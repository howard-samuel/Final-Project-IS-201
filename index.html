    Because the slices are large, just one slice is often more than what you might think — many people find it quite
    filling on its own.

    ✅ Why People Like Costco Pizza

    Value for money — $9.95 for an 18″ pizza is very cheap compared to many chain pizzas, especially given its size.

    Simplicity and consistency — few topping choices but generally available (cheese or pepperoni); not a lot of
    variability means you usually know what you’re getting.

    Convenient after shopping — easy to grab a slice or a whole pie at the food court while you're already at Costco.

    ⚠️ Some Downsides / What to Watch Out For

    Limited topping options — unlike many pizzerias, Costco pizza basically just comes in cheese or pepperoni.
    Parade

    High in calories and fat — a slice is often ~650–710 calories, which adds up fast if you have more than one.
    Contentful
    +1

    Nutritional density — besides high calories, slices are heavy in fat, carbs, and likely sodium (common in big
    fast-food–style pizzas).
